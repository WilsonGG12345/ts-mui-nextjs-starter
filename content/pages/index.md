          Process mapping is a technique used to view and understand all the
          steps involved in a business process, from the beginning to the end.
          It helps identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks and opportunities for
          improvement.


          Process mapping benefits:


          Clarity: provides a clear view of how the process really works.


          Identification of inefficiencies: highlights areas where resources may
          be wasted.


          Continuous improvement: Facilitates the identification of improvements
          to increase efficiency and quality.


          Alignment: ensures that all team members understand the process and
          their responsibilities.


          Documentation: Creates valuable documentation that can be used for
          training and standardization.


          Common tools:


          FlowGrams: Diagrams that show the sequence of steps.


          Value chain maps: focus on delivering customer value.


          Sipoc Diagrams: identify suppliers, entries, process, outputs and
          customers.


          In short, process mapping is a vital tool for any organization that
          seeks to optimize their operations and continually improve.
